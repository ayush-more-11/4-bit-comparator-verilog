# 4-bit-comparator-verilog
Design and simulation of a 4-bit magnitude comparator using Verilog HDL with behavioral modeling and a verification testbench.

The comparator compares two 4-bit binary numbers and determines whether:
- A > B
- A < B
- A = B

The design is written using behavioral modeling and verified using a testbench.
